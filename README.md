Please find below my Nextjs project TitanXUtils.  This part is concentrating on 4 NFT colections and analysing their data.

Element369, Stax and Ascendant are complete.

I am still trying to perfect the Element280 NFT collection.
All 4 of these are on Ethereum.
I also have a placeholder for future collection E280; this will be deployed on BASE

I have a few components that are important for this analysis.
It shoud be noted that any code changes and enhancements/testing scripts should not risk breaking the work we've already done for  Element369, Stax and Ascendant 


Please let me know if you need me to share the contents of any source file to help your analysis.


  We've just finished the population of a database for Element280 NFTs data.
  We used the scripts // scripts/trackElement280NFTs.js

The below is definite states for the following 3 wallets so that we can test and check output.
We have run through  the tests and the database seems to match up so we good to move forward.

These 3 are the wallets that I own:
0x15702443110894B26911B913b17ea4931F803B02
0xF98f0ee190d9f2E6531E226933f1E47a2890CbDA
0x9D641961a31B3eED46e664fA631aAD3021323862

wallet: 0x15702443110894B26911B913b17ea4931F803B02
this output should be the following:
Element 280, live nfts count 29, 5 amped legendary, 1 legendary, 6 rare amped and 17 amp common: 
Minted 2  
Tiers minted  [0,0,0,0,0,2]
Transferred in  28
Transferred out  1
Burned 0

wallet: 0xF98f0ee190d9f2E6531E226933f1E47a2890CbDA
this output should be the following:
Element 280, live nfts count 0
Minted 22 
Tiers minted  [[0,17,0,3,0,2]
Transferred in 6
Transferred out 27
Burned 1

wallet: 0x9D641961a31B3eED46e664fA631aAD3021323862
this output should be the following:
Element 280, live nfts count 0
Minted 0
Tiers minted   [0,0,0,0,0,0]
Transferred in 2
Transferred out 2
Burned 0

The current claimable reward Element280 tokens for wallet 0x15702443110894B26911B913b17ea4931F803B02 is currently 1,301,036,482 and my current % of rewards is 1.199%

This is because it is only valid for wallets that currently own at least bone element280 NFT to have a current claimable amount.  This information can be used with the Element280Vault contract and abi to calculate the Claimable value for a wallet.  

The project code and data sources that I think we need for our further analysis is below.

Thank you for the additional requirements. To summarize, the solution must:
Be specific to Element 280, ensuring no impact on other NFT collections.

Address potential database staleness by querying the blockchain for the latest data while using the element280.db database for wallet-specific data and complex aggregates.

Update the element280.db database with any new data obtained from the blockchain to keep it as up-to-date as possible.

Resolve the SQLITE_ERROR: table element280_summary has no column named totalRewardPool issue for the NFT->ETH->Element280 page.

Ensure the solution is quick, easy, and verifies the three wallets’ data from wallets.json.

We’ll implement a hybrid approach that:
Fetches real-time data (totalRewardPool, multiplierPool, totalSupply, totalBurned, totalMinted, totalLive, lastBlock, totalWallets, tierDistribution) from the Element 280 NFT and vault contracts using a single multicall and Alchemy’s getOwnersForContract.

Queries the database (element280.db) for wallet-specific data (element280_wallets) and burnedDistribution, as computing historical burn data on-chain is complex.

Updates the element280_summary table with fresh blockchain data to keep it up-to-date.

Ensures all changes are isolated to Element 280-specific code (/api/holders/Element280, public/data/element280.db, and optionally trackElement280NFTs.js).

This approach resolves the SQLITE_ERROR, ensures real-time accuracy, keeps the database updated, and remains specific to Element 280.
Key Considerations
Element 280 Specificity:
Modify only /api/holders/Element280 (or equivalent, e.g., app/api/holders/Element280/route.js or pages/api/holders/Element280.js).

Use public/data/element280.db, isolated from other collections’ databases.

Reference only Element 280’s CONTRACT_ADDRESS (NFT) and VAULT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS (vault).

Avoid shared utilities or ABIs used by other collections.

Handling Database Staleness:
Fetch totalRewardPool, multiplierPool, totalSupply, totalBurned, totalMinted, totalLive, lastBlock, totalWallets, and tierDistribution from the blockchain for real-time data.

Query element280_wallets for wallet data and element280_summary for burnedDistribution (historical data).

Update element280_summary with new blockchain data to keep it current.

Database Updates:
Add totalRewardPool to element280_summary schema to store blockchain-fetched data.

Update totalWallets, tierDistribution, and other fields in element280_summary with blockchain data.

Ensure element280_wallets updates are handled by trackElement280NFTs.js (existing script).

Solution Goals:
Resolve SQLITE_ERROR by adding totalRewardPool to the database and fetching it on-chain.

Ensure real-time data for critical metrics.

Maintain performance by leveraging the database for wallet data.

Keep changes minimal and Element 280-specific.

Implementation
Step 1: Update the Database Schema
Since the SQLITE_ERROR indicates element280_summary lacks a totalRewardPool column, we’ll add it to the schema. This requires updating trackElement280NFTs.js to include totalRewardPool and ensure the database is ready for updates from the API handler.
Update initDb in trackElement280NFTs.js:


its not just the summary table that needs to be updated with the latet data.  All the tables in the batabase need to be aswell.  These tables can be seen in the file scripts/trackElement280NFTs.jsspecifically the tables are described by the creation code in this file:


      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      totalMinted INTEGER,
      totalBurned INTEGER,
      totalLive INTEGER,
      totalWallets INTEGER,
      tierDistribution TEXT,
      burnedDistribution TEXT,
      multiplierPool INTEGER,
      lastBlock INTEGER
    );
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS element280_transfers (
      tokenId TEXT,
      fromAddr TEXT,
      toAddr TEXT,
      tier INTEGER,
      blockNumber INTEGER,
      transactionHash TEXT,
      blockTimestamp INTEGER,
      eventType TEXT,
      multiplierPool INTEGER,
      totalSupply INTEGER,
      totalBurned INTEGER,
      ownerAddr TEXT,
      PRIMARY KEY (tokenId, transactionHash, eventType)
    );
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS element280_wallets (
      address TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
      totalLive INTEGER,
      totalBurned INTEGER,
      totalBought INTEGER,
      totalSold INTEGER,
      minted INTEGER,

      tiersBurned TEXT,
      tiersMinted TEXT,
      tiersTransferredIn TEXT,
      tiersTransferredOut TEXT,
      nfts TEXT,
      multiplierSum INTEGER,
      displayMultiplierSum REAL
    );
    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_transfers_addresses ON element280_transfers(fromAddr, toAddr);
    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_transfers_tokenId ON element280_transfers(tokenId);
    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_transfers_eventType ON element280_transfers(eventType);
    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_transfers_blockNumber ON element280_transfers(blockNumber);
  `);```



  Element 369: show Unique Wallets, Active NFTs, Inferno , Flux and Element 280 Rewards
Element 280: show unique wallets, NUmber live NFTs, number burned NFTs,  keep the live NFTs distribution list
Stax:  Unique wallets, NUm live NFTs, NUmber of burned NFts, the live NFTs distribution list if available
Ascendant:  Unique wallets, Active NFTs, Total Ascendant Locked, Total Claimable rewards, Total Pending REwards


=======================

Step 3: Summary of Progress
What We’ve Done:
Initial Analysis:
Identified 500 errors for /nft, /api/holders/Element280, /api/holders/Stax, and /api/holders/Ascendant.

Confirmed the use of Zustand for client-side caching (useNFTStore) and the goal of using Redis for server-side caching.

Analyzed app/nft-contracts.js for contract configurations:
Element280: 0x7F090d101936008a26Bf1F0a22a5f92fC0Cf46c9, vault: 0x44c4ADAc7d88f85d3D33A7f856Ebc54E60C31E97.

Stax: 0x74270Ca3a274B4dbf26be319A55188690CACE6E1, vault: 0x5D27813C32dD705404d1A78c9444dAb523331717.

Ascendant: 0x9da95c32c5869c84ba2c020b5e87329ec0adc97f, no vault.

Element369: Not fully shared but assumed similar.

API Route Fixes:
Element369: Updated app/api/holders/Element369/route.js to use Redis (getCache, setCache), added retry logic, and improved error handling (not shared by you, assumed similar to Stax).

Stax: Updated app/api/holders/Stax/route.js to use Redis, added retry logic for Alchemy calls, and fixed potential contract call issues.

Element280: Updated app/api/holders/Element280/route.js to replace in-memory cache, holdersMapCache, and tokenCache with Redis. Fixed progress/route.js to work with Redis-based getCacheState.

Ascendant: Updated app/api/holders/Ascendant/route.js to use Redis, fixed burn address typo, and improved retry logic.

Client-Side Fixes:
NFTPage.js: Updated components/NFTPage.js to:
Increase fetch timeout to 120 seconds.

Make /progress fetch non-critical.

Add detailed error logging for fetchContractData and fetchAllHolders.

Include a cache clear button.

NFTLayout.js: Updated app/nft/layout.js to:
Increase fetch timeout to 60 seconds.

Remove ascendantNFT cache bypass.

Add detailed error logging.

Include a cache clear button.

NFTOverview.js: Updated app/nft/page.js to improve styling and messaging.

Caching:
Server-Side: All API routes (Element369, Stax, Element280, Ascendant) now use Redis for caching, replacing in-memory or LRUCache implementations.

Client-Side: NFTPage.js and NFTLayout.js use Zustand for caching, with a button to clear the cache.

Remaining Issues:
Element280 500 Error: May be caused by app/api/holders/Element280/route cache db.js if it’s the active route using LRUCache.

NFT Page 500 Error: Likely due to API failures; requires app/nft/[chain]/[contract]/page.js to confirm how NFTPage.js is rendered.

Missing Files: Need app/api/holders/Element280/route cache db.js and app/nft/[chain]/[contract]/page.js.

Current Status:
API Routes: Updated to use Redis, with improved retry logic and error handling. 500 errors should be reduced, but Element280 needs confirmation on route cache db.js.

NFT Page: Updated NFTPage.js and NFTLayout.js to handle errors better and use Zustand caching. The /nft 500 error persists due to missing dynamic route handler.

Testing Needed: Verify API endpoints and dynamic routes (e.g., /nft/ETH/Element280).
