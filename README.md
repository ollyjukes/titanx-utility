Please find below my Nextjs project TitanXUtils.  This part is concentrating on 4 NFT colections and analysing their data.

Element369, Stax and Ascendant are complete.

I am still trying to perfect the Element280 NFT collection.
All 4 of these are on Ethereum.
I also have a placeholder for future collection E280; this will be deployed on BASE

I have a few components that are important for this analysis.
It shoud be noted that any code changes and enhancements/testing scripts should not risk breaking the work we've already done for  Element369, Stax and Ascendant 


These 3 are the wallets that I own:
0x15702443110894B26911B913b17ea4931F803B02
0xF98f0ee190d9f2E6531E226933f1E47a2890CbDA
0x9D641961a31B3eED46e664fA631aAD3021323862

wallet: 0x15702443110894B26911B913b17ea4931F803B02
this output should be the following:
Element 280, live nfts count 29, 5 amped legendary, 1 legendary, 6 rare amped and 17 amp common: 
Minted 2  
Tiers minted  [0,0,0,0,0,2]
Transferred in  28
Transferred out  1
Burned 0

wallet: 0xF98f0ee190d9f2E6531E226933f1E47a2890CbDA
this output should be the following:
Element 280, live nfts count 0
Minted 22 
Tiers minted  [[0,17,0,3,0,2]
Transferred in 6
Transferred out 27
Burned 1

wallet: 0x9D641961a31B3eED46e664fA631aAD3021323862
this output should be the following:
Element 280, live nfts count 0
Minted 0
Tiers minted   [0,0,0,0,0,0]
Transferred in 2
Transferred out 2
Burned 0

The current claimable reward Element280 tokens for wallet 0x15702443110894B26911B913b17ea4931F803B02 is currently 1,301,036,482 and my current % of rewards is 1.199%

This is because it is only valid for wallets that currently own at least bone element280 NFT to have a current claimable amount.  This information can be used with the Element280Vault contract and abi to calculate the Claimable value for a wallet.  

The project code and data sources that I think we need for our further analysis is below.

===========next

Thank you for the additional requirements. To summarize, the solution must:
Be specific to Element 280, ensuring no impact on other NFT collections.

Address potential database staleness by querying the blockchain for the latest data while using the element280.db database for wallet-specific data and complex aggregates.

Update the element280.db database with any new data obtained from the blockchain to keep it as up-to-date as possible.

Resolve the SQLITE_ERROR: table element280_summary has no column named totalRewardPool issue for the NFT->ETH->Element280 page.

Ensure the solution is quick, easy, and verifies the three wallets’ data from wallets.json.

We’ll implement a hybrid approach that:
Fetches real-time data (totalRewardPool, multiplierPool, totalSupply, totalBurned, totalMinted, totalLive, lastBlock, totalWallets, tierDistribution) from the Element 280 NFT and vault contracts using a single multicall and Alchemy’s getOwnersForContract.

Queries the database (element280.db) for wallet-specific data (element280_wallets) and burnedDistribution, as computing historical burn data on-chain is complex.

Updates the element280_summary table with fresh blockchain data to keep it up-to-date.

Ensures all changes are isolated to Element 280-specific code (/api/holders/Element280, public/data/element280.db, and optionally trackElement280NFTs.js).

This approach resolves the SQLITE_ERROR, ensures real-time accuracy, keeps the database updated, and remains specific to Element 280.
Key Considerations
Element 280 Specificity:
Modify only /api/holders/Element280 (or equivalent, e.g., app/api/holders/Element280/route.js or pages/api/holders/Element280.js).

Use public/data/element280.db, isolated from other collections’ databases.

Reference only Element 280’s CONTRACT_ADDRESS (NFT) and VAULT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS (vault).

Avoid shared utilities or ABIs used by other collections.

Handling Database Staleness:
Fetch totalRewardPool, multiplierPool, totalSupply, totalBurned, totalMinted, totalLive, lastBlock, totalWallets, and tierDistribution from the blockchain for real-time data.

Query element280_wallets for wallet data and element280_summary for burnedDistribution (historical data).

Update element280_summary with new blockchain data to keep it current.

Database Updates:
Add totalRewardPool to element280_summary schema to store blockchain-fetched data.

Update totalWallets, tierDistribution, and other fields in element280_summary with blockchain data.

Ensure element280_wallets updates are handled by trackElement280NFTs.js (existing script).

Solution Goals:
Resolve SQLITE_ERROR by adding totalRewardPool to the database and fetching it on-chain.

Ensure real-time data for critical metrics.

Maintain performance by leveraging the database for wallet data.

Keep changes minimal and Element 280-specific.

Implementation
Step 1: Update the Database Schema
Since the SQLITE_ERROR indicates element280_summary lacks a totalRewardPool column, we’ll add it to the schema. This requires updating trackElement280NFTs.js to include totalRewardPool and ensure the database is ready for updates from the API handler.
Update initDb in trackElement280NFTs.js:


its not just the summary table that needs to be updated with the latet data.  All the tables in the batabase need to be aswell.  These tables can be seen in the file scripts/trackElement280NFTs.jsspecifically the tables are described by the creation code in this file:


      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,

#  NFT Holders API

## Project Overview

The **Element280 NFT Holders API** is a Next.js-based backend service designed to provide real-time data about NFT holders for the `Element280` collection on Ethereum. It fetches and caches ownership, supply, and burn data for NFTs, serving endpoints for holder lists, progress tracking, and burn event validation. The API is built to handle high query volumes efficiently using in-memory caching, with plans to support multiple NFT collections.

### Key Features
- **Holders Data (`GET /api/holders/Element280`)**: Returns paginated lists of holders with wallet addresses, NFT counts, tiers, rewards, and rankings.
- **Cache Preload (`POST /api/holders/Element280`)**: Populates an in-memory cache with holder data for fast subsequent queries.
- **Progress Tracking (`GET /api/holders/Element280/progress`)**: Reports cache population status, total holders, and progress percentage.
- **Burn Validation (`GET /api/holders/Element280/validate-burned`)**: Lists burned NFTs (transferred to `0x0000...0000`) with token IDs, tiers, and transaction details.
- **In-Memory Caching**: Uses a custom `inMemoryStorage` singleton to cache data, with Redis support disabled (`DISABLE_ELEMENT280_REDIS=true`). - 
Would like to add more variables similar -  THIS NEEDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED SIMILAR TO THE ABOVE
`DISABLE_ELEMENT369_REDIS=true`
`DISABLE_STAX_REDIS=true`
`DISABLE_ASCENDANT_REDIS=true`
`DISABLE_E280_REDIS=true`

- **Blockchain Integration**: Queries Ethereum via Alchemy SDK and Viem for contract calls (`totalSupply` , `ownerOf`, `getNftTier`, `getRewards`) and event logs (`Transfer`).
please note totalSupply is badly named in the API.  THis actually means totalLiveSupply

### Current Status
- **Codebase**: The API is implemented in Next.js 14.2.28, with primary logic in:
  - `/app/api/holders/Element280/route.js`: Handles GET/POST for holders data and cache population.
  - `/app/api/holders/Element280/progress/route.js`: Reports cache progress.
  - `/app/api/holders/Element280/validate-burned/route.js`: Validates burned NFTs.
  - Supporting utilities in `/app/api/utils.js` and contract ABIs in `/app/nft-contracts.js`.

- **Data**:
  - Total Minted: 16,883 NFTs. ( this will never changed and shoud be hardcoded)
  - Total Live: 8,107 NFTs.  ( this is the current niumber as of now.  maybe less the next time we check. can only go down to 0)
  - Total Burned: 8,776 NFTs (via `Transfer` events to `0x0000...0000`). ( this is the current number as of now.  maybe more the next time we check. can only go up to a max of Total Minted)
  - Total Holders: 920 wallets ( as of now)
- **Dependencies**: `viem`, `p-limit`, Next.js.
- **Environment**: `DISABLE_ELEMENT280_REDIS=true`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY` set in `.env.local`.


### Intentions
- **Fix Progress Endpoint**: Ensure caching persists `totalOwners: 920` and `phase: "Completed"` after POST.
- **Optimize `/validate-burned`**: Cache results, add progress logging, and batch `getNftTier` calls.
- **Isolate Cache per Collection**: Modify `inMemoryStorage` to use a map keyed by contract address to support multiple collections without conflicts. Done already ?  maybe
- **Improve Caching**: Replace `inMemoryStorage` with `node-cache` for robustness, TTL support, and eviction policies. - DONE
- **Fix Tier Distribution**: Debug and resolve failed `getTotalNftsPerTiers` and `multiplierPool` calls.
- **Enhance Reliability**: Add error handling, retries, and logging for all blockchain interactions.

### Plan Going Forward
1. **Immediate Fixes** (Next 1-2 days):
   - Update `route.js` to log `inMemoryCacheState` changes and detect resets.
   - Test in production mode (`npm run build && npm run start`) to avoid dev mode hot reloads.
   - Optimize `/validate-burned` with caching and progress logs.
   - Debug `tierDistribution` and `multiplierPool` failures using contract call logs.
2. **Cache Isolation** (Next 3-5 days): - doing now
   - Modify `inMemoryStorage` to use `inMemoryStorage[contractAddress]` for collection-specific data.
   - Test with a second NFT collection to ensure no overwrites.
3. **Switch to `node-cache`** (Next 5-7 days): switched already
   - Integrate `node-cache` for in-memory caching with TTL and eviction.
   - Update all cache operations (`getCacheState`, `inMemoryHoldersMap`, `burnedEventsCache`) to use `node-cache`.
   - Benchmark performance and memory usage.
4. **Long-Term Improvements** (Next 2-4 weeks):
   - Add streaming responses for `/validate-burned` to handle large datasets.
   - Implement Redis fallback for high-traffic scenarios.
   - Add unit tests for cache isolation and blockchain queries.
   - Document API endpoints and caching strategy in Swagger/OpenAPI.


////////////////////////////////  New Summary

Updated README.md Summary for TitanX Utility
Project Overview
TitanX Utility is a Next.js-based web application designed to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with Ethereum-based NFT collections, specifically Element280, Element369, Stax, Ascendant, and E280. The project integrates with blockchain data via Alchemy, Viem, and Upstash Redis to fetch and display real-time information about NFT holders, token attributes, rewards, and burned tokens. The frontend, accessible at routes like /nft/ETH/Element280, presents this data in tabular formats, while the backend API (/api/holders/*) handles on-chain queries and caching for performance. The application supports both Ethereum (ETH) and Base (BASE) chains, with features for auctions, mining, and NFT analytics.
Goals
The primary goals of TitanX Utility are:
Real-Time NFT Analytics: Provide accurate, up-to-date information on NFT ownership, tiers, shares, and rewards for collections like Element280 (burned token tracking), Element369 (Inferno/Flux/E280 rewards), Stax (vault rewards), and Ascendant (time-based rewards: Day 8/28/90).

Scalable Backend: Implement robust API endpoints (/api/holders/*, /api/holders/Element280/progress, /api/holders/Element280/validate-burned) with caching (Redis or in-memory via node-cache) to handle high query volumes and Alchemy rate limits.

User-Friendly Frontend: Deliver a responsive UI with dynamic routes (/nft/[chain]/[contract]) for exploring NFT data, supporting pagination and wallet-specific queries.

Reliability and Optimization: Ensure the application is stable, with minimal errors, optimized bundle sizes, and efficient blockchain interactions within Alchemy’s free tier limits.

Extensibility: Support future collections (e.g., E280 when deployed) and additional features like auctions and mining analytics.

Current Status (as of April 25, 2025)
The TitanX Utility project is in a stable state, with ongoing updates to centralize configuration and eliminate hardcoded values. Key milestones and updates include:
Configuration Centralization
Centralized config.js: Replaced app/nft-contracts.js with config.js, using ES Modules (import/export) to consolidate all configuration parameters, including:
Contract addresses, vault addresses, deployment blocks, and tiers for Element280, Element369, Stax, Ascendant, and E280.

ABI imports for all collections (element280.json, element280Vault.json, element369.json, element369Vault.json, staxNFT.json, staxVault.json, ascendantNFT.json) moved to config.js.

Alchemy settings (batchSize: 10, batchDelayMs: 1000, maxRetries: 3) optimized for the free tier.

Cache settings (Redis and node-cache) and debug toggles.

Files Updated:
app/api/utils.js: Converted to ES Modules, uses config.js for Alchemy and cache settings.

app/api/holders/Stax/route.js: Updated to use config.js for contract details, tiers, and ABIs (config.abis.stax.main, config.abis.stax.vault).



to check: Synchronous Blocking: Asynchronous POST handler in app/api/holders/Element280/route.js reduced delays from ~153 seconds to ~0.118 seconds.

to check:  Cache Population: Element280 cache population completes (totalOwners: ~920, phase: "Completed") with enhanced populateHoldersMapCache and debug logging.

Fixed MaxListenersExceededWarning: Added debounced saveCacheState in app/api/utils.js and cleaned up listeners in Element280/route.js and validate-burned/route.js.

Fixed /progress Endpoint: Added state validation in app/api/holders/Element280/progress/route.js to prevent crashes.

Fixed Duplicate saveCacheState: Removed duplicate definition in app/api/utils.js.

Reduced Log Noise: Conditional logging in app/api/utils.js (enabled only when DEBUG=true or NODE_ENV=development).

Caching Implementation
All collections (Element280, Element369, Stax, Ascendant) support Redis caching (via Upstash) and in-memory caching (node-cache) with toggles (DISABLE_*_REDIS in .env.local).

E280 is disabled, returning { error: "E280 contract not yet deployed" }, with caching placeholders for future activation.

Cache population for Element280 is optimized with batchSize: 10 and batchDelayMs: 1000 to stay within Alchemy’s free tier limits.

Frontend Routes
Dynamic routes (/nft/[chain]/[contract]) render correctly for Element280, Element369, Stax, and Ascendant when data is available.

E280 displays a disabled message as expected.

Additional pages (/auctions, /mining, /about) are static and functional.


Optimizations
Alchemy batch size set to 10 in config.js to balance rate limits.

Conditional logging reduces build and runtime noise.

ABIs centralized in config.js for consistency, reducing redundancy in source files.

Test each updated file to ensure functionality (e.g., cache population, frontend rendering).

Testing:
Run the following commands to verify API endpoints:

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/holders/Element280"
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/holders/Element280/progress"
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/holders/Element280"
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/holders/Stax"
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/holders/Element369"
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/holders/Ascendant"

Save outputs to test.log and inspect for expected data (e.g., holder counts, rewards, burned tokens).

Test frontend routes (/nft/ETH/Element280, /nft/ETH/Stax, etc.) in a browser, checking for rendering issues or console errors.

Enable DEBUG=true in .env.local for detailed logs, then disable for production.

Frontend Validation:
Verify HolderTable components (HolderTable/Element280.js, HolderTable/Element369.js, etc.) display data correctly (e.g., multiplierSum, shares, rewards).

Ensure no a.holders is undefined errors in the browser console.

Performance Optimization:
Monitor Alchemy rate limit errors (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests) in server.log. Adjust config.alchemy.batchSize (e.g., to 5) or batchDelayMs (e.g., to 2000) if needed.

Evaluate bundle size for /nft/[chain]/[contract] (currently 143 kB). Consider lazy-loading ABIs in config.js if size becomes an issue.

E280 Deployment:
Prepare app/api/holders/E280/route.js for activation by updating config.js with E280’s contract address and ABI once deployed.

Documentation:
Update README.md with:
Setup instructions (e.g., .env.local configuration, dependency installation).

API usage examples (e.g., curl commands).

Environment variable descriptions.

Testing and deployment guidelines.

Known Considerations
Bundle Size: The /nft/[chain]/[contract] route has a bundle size of 143 kB due to ABI imports and blockchain dependencies. Lazy-loading ABIs or moving them to route-specific files may improve load times.

Alchemy Rate Limits: High traffic may trigger rate limits. Monitor batchMulticall errors and adjust config.alchemy settings if necessary.

ABI Consistency: Ensure ABI files in abi/ (element369.json, staxNFT.json, etc.) match on-chain contracts and are versioned in git.

Summary of Testing Progress
Project Context:
Goal: Populate caches for Element280, Element369, Stax, Ascendant, and E280, and display complete data in the frontend without partial data or errors.

Initial Issues:
Synchronous POST handler caused ~153-second delays.

Enhanced populateHoldersMapCache with debug logging.

Centralized configuration in config.js with ES Modules.

Moved ABIs to config.js for consistency.

Optimized Alchemy settings (batchSize: 10, batchDelayMs: 1000).

Thank you for sharing the app/nft/[chain]/[contract]/page.js file and clarifying your requirements. I understand your goal: each NFT collection (Element369, Element280, Stax, Ascendant, E280) should have its own cache, and the browser should check this cache before rendering the page. If the data is cached, the page should display immediately; if not, it should show a loading/fetching message until the data is ready. Importantly, rendering one collection (e.g., Element369) should not depend on other collections’ cache states—each collection’s cache is independent.


Summary for README
Current State: The application fetches and displays NFT holder data for collections (Element369, Element280, Stax, Ascendant, E280) using Alchemy and viem, with server-side caching (NodeCache) and client-side caching (useNFTStore). However, excessive logging occurs despite DEBUG=false, and a Next.js error in app/nft/[chain]/[contract]/page.js (synchronous params access) prevents page rendering. Element280’s cache population is slow (fetching_supply), causing delays.
Goals:
Fix Logging: Ensure DEBUG=false outputs only [ERROR] and [VALIDATION] logs, using pino-pretty for readability.

Resolve Next.js Error: Await params in page.js to render NFTPageWrapper and NFTPage.

Enhance Caching: Use independent caches per collection, polling /progress endpoints to wait for server-side cache completion.

Improve Loading: Display loading states (<LoadingIndicator>) until each collection’s cache is ready, ensuring smooth switching between collections.

Support All Collections: Implement consistent /progress endpoints for Element369, Stax, Ascendant, and E280, matching Element280’s setup.

Recap of Current State
Environment: Node.js 18.20.8 (incompatible with @solana/* dependencies requiring >=20.18.0), Next.js 15.3.1, and a clean node_modules install after removing package-lock.json and .next.

Errors:
MODULE_NOT_FOUND for /Users/ollyjukes/nextjs.projects/titanx-utility/.next/server/chunks/lib/worker.js, causing worker thread crashes.

GET /api/holders/Element369?page=0&pageSize=1000 400, likely due to missing configuration in config.js.

Node.js version warnings for @solana/codecs-numbers@2.1.0, @solana/codecs-core@2.1.0, and @solana/errors@2.1.0.

ESLint warnings for unused variables (can be addressed later if needed).

Build: npm run build succeeds, but runtime errors occur in both dev and start modes.

Next Config: Empty ({}), so no experimental features or misconfigurations are causing the issue.

Action Plan
1. Resolve MODULE_NOT_FOUND for worker.js
The worker.js error suggests a bug or compatibility issue with Next.js 15.3.1 or a dependency interfering with the build process. Since downgrading Next.js and upgrading Node.js were suggested, let’s prioritize the Node.js upgrade due to the @solana/* dependency requirements, then retest with Next.js adjustments.
Upgrade Node.js to 20.18.0:
The @solana/* packages require Node.js >=20.18.0, and running on 18.20.8 may cause runtime issues. Upgrade using nvm:
